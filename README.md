# CryWolf
Today each website has almost billions of other websites in its backend to support the whole structure and from these billions support web links millions of them are either vulnerable of are based on either low grade or no usage of any security protocol. The structure developed is based on a usual website crawler that in general would just be fetching all the hyperlinks and reference to and from that website, on the top of it, a dynamic accessor has been formed to test these links on separate basis for various possible ways of compromises, which can be further appended based on the needs and wants of the user. And taking the suggestion from the Cranorâ€™s work the usability ratio of the warning has been tried to improve for better user understanding and keep them away from such malicious weblinks as shown in the figure below.

The scanner executes to firstly validate the SSL certificate of these links prior to any further action. Once the SSL certificate is verified the tests are performed on each of the links and forms on the website, and without any further delay in case of a vulnerable area the alert is sent to the user with a virtually developed method of warning the user, on the side of which the code itself works to take the user to safer platform by both closing the current browser, raising a proper alert formed with keeping usability ratio in mind and allowing user to either learn more about the issue or close the same, while on the other hand if no issues are found user are allowed a proper safe surfing.
